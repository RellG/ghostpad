### FAQ

**Q: Are my notes really deleted?**

A: No, that's the point! GhostPad Pro is designed for temporary notes. Always export important information before closing.

**Q: Does it work offline?**
A: Yes! GhostPad Pro works completely offline. No internet connection required.

**Q: Is it safe for passwords?**
A: GhostPad Pro is great for staging passwords temporarily, but we recommend using a dedicated password manager for long-term storage.

**Q: What's the difference from regular notepad?**
A: GhostPad Pro automatically clears notes when you close your browser, has multiple tabs, markdown support, self-destruct timers, and is privacy-focused.

**Q: Can I use it on multiple computers?**
A: Yes, install the extension on each computer. However, notes don't sync (by design for privacy).
