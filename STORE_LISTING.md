## Store Response Templates

### FAQ

**Q: Are my notes stored in the cloud?**
A: No! All notes are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API. They never leave your device (except premium verification uses email only).

**Q: Can I recover a password-protected note if I forget the password?**
A: No - this is by design for true security. Your password is never stored, and the note is encrypted with AES-256-GCM. If you forget your password, the note cannot be decrypted.

**Q: Does it work offline?**
A: Yes! GhostPad works completely offline. Internet is only required for premium subscription verification.

**Q: What's the difference between Free and Premium?**
A: Free tier gives you 3 notes with ALL features (encryption, reminders, themes, etc.). Premium ($1.99/month) unlocks unlimited notes (up to 1,000) and cross-device premium sync.

**Q: How does premium activation work?**
A: After subscribing via Stripe, enter your payment email in Settings > Premium. Activation is instant. Premium status syncs across all your Chrome browsers when signed in.

**Q: Can I use it on multiple computers?**
A: Yes! Install the extension on each computer. Notes don't sync (for privacy), but your premium status does sync across devices.

**Q: Does it collect any data?**
A: No! Zero data collection, zero tracking, zero analytics. Only your email is stored for premium verification - we never see your note content.

**Q: Is my payment information secure?**
A: Yes! All payments are processed by Stripe (industry leader in payment security). We never see or store your credit card information.
